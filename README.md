# Introduction

Welcome to BISCSL-TECH. This organization is where all code made from students @ BISCSL will be stored as well as documented!

Below is an overview of how the organization works

 - Any repositories related to Science Olympiad will be private untilthe date of a competition (it would then be public ONLY for the competition day)
 - Any repositories related to CASE work will be public (this means that everyone in the organization can see it)
